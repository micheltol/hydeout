Hi, my name is Michel, born and raised in the Netherlands.

I am an independent Software Engineer - Architect focussing on the Microsoft .NET stack with more than 17 years of experience. I started my career as a VB6 programmer and moved on to VB.NET, BizTalk, SharePoint, C# & Angular.

I worked across different industries like: social security, automotive, financial, public transport and retail.

Currently I am more and more focussing on CICD (Continious Integration - Continious Delivery), DevOps practices, Kubernetes, application scaling, performance tuning and application monitoring. By applying these best practices I think the quality of software can dramaticly be improved.

Since 2017 I am working remotely from around the world, currently I am in Cape Town, South Africa.

In my spare time I love to travel, to play with my 2 kids, to mudrun, to hike and I love to geek out with my smoker and bbq.
