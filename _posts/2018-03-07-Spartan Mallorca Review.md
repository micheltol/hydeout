Last weekend I attended my first Spartan race (of 2018) in Mallorca. While planning the trip we decided to stay an extra couple of days on the island and enjoy the weather and food. 

Leaving Thursday morning while the ['beast from the east'](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/9730423/The-Beast-from-the-East-dumps-snow-on-Europe-and-is-heading-for-Britain.html) was at it's peak we took the first plane to Mallorca. Coming from -9°C and arriving 3 hours later in +18°C is just magic.  

We picked up our car (a brand new Ford Focus, thanks Herz!) and spent the rest of the day exploring the east side of the island. Visiting places like Llucmajor, Cala D'or or Cales de Mallorca in lowseason is like visiting the citycenter of my hometown on a tuesday morning. These villages were totally abandoned. Especially Cala D'or or Cales de Mallorca are packed with tourists in the summer but now we hardly seen anybody.

One of the luxuries of traveling without your children is that you can sleep in and that is what we did. The friday morning we slept in and had a nice bruch at la Plaça Major. After brunch we packed our stuff for a hike from Alaró to Castell d'Alaró - a ruined castle and hilltop chapel offering spectacular views of the Tramuntana mountains and over towards Palma and all the way to the sea. 

According to the description it would take  2 to 2.5 hours to get up to the castle.  Arriving in Alaró at 14:00 hours with a +/- 4 hours hike in front of us, we had to made some progress and do it fast ;). In little bit less then 1.5 hour we arrived at Castell d'Alaró. On top of the hill there is a small chapel and cafe where we stopped for a sandwich (pan con jamon) before starting our walk down. 

Saturday... race day! Nahh more like race afternoon. Starttime 1545 gave us another oppertunity to sleep in. :)
